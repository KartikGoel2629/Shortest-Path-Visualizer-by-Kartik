# Shortest Path Visualizer

## 🧭 About
- This project provides a **graphical simulation of shortest-path algorithms** on a grid.  
- You can **interactively place obstacles**, choose start and end nodes, and see how various algorithms explore the grid and find paths.  
- Built in **Python** using **Pygame** for rendering and interaction.

## ⚙️ Features — Supported Algorithms

### 🧮 Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** — guarantees shortest path in unweighted grids  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** — does *not* guarantee shortest path  
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** — works for weighted or unweighted graphs (guarantees shortest path)  
- **A\*** (**A-Star**) — heuristic-driven search, typically faster, still finds shortest path  

### ✨ Other Features
- 🟩 Interactive grid — click to create obstacles, set start & end points  
- 🔄 Clear / reset grid  
- 👣 Visual step-by-step exploration  
- ⏩ Speed control *(if implemented)*  
- 🎨 Real-time feedback with coloring of visited nodes & final path

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🗺️ Grid Representation
- The map is represented as a **2D grid (rows × columns)**.  
- Each cell (tile) represents a **node** that may be open or an obstacle.  

### 🔗 Neighbors & Edges
- From each non-obstacle tile, edges connect to its **neighboring tiles** (up, down, left, right, or optionally diagonals).  

### ⚡ Algorithm Execution
- **BFS / DFS** — use a **queue or stack** to explore neighbors.  
- **Dijkstra / A\*** — maintain a **priority queue**, **distance map**, **parent pointers**, and (for A\*) a **heuristic function**.  

### 🎬 Visualization Steps
- 🟦 Mark nodes as *visited* by changing their color.  
- 🟨 When the target node is reached, **backtrack** through parent links to draw the final path.  
- 🧩 Optionally show “frontier” nodes, cost labels, or distances.  

### 🖱️ User Interaction
- **Left-click** on a cell → toggle obstacle  
- **Right-click** → place **Start** or **End** node  
- Use **buttons / UI controls** to:
  - Start the algorithm  
  - Reset or clear the grid  
- *(Optional)* Allow **speed control**, **pause**, or **step-by-step** visualization

### Usage:
- `LEFT CLICK` to make obstacle
- `RIGHT CLICK` to create start and end node
- buttons for running algorithms
### To Run
install `pygame` pacakge
```
pip install pygame
```
then run the 'main.py' file
```
python main.py
```
